            <ul>
                <li>The Canadian publishing house behind the "Franklin" children's books appeared to condemn Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, after he posted a cartoon image of the turtle blowing up a boat.</li>
                <li>Hegseth shared an image on Twitter that depicts Franklin the Turtle holding a detonator as a boat explodes in the background, with the caption "Boating Accidents are on the rise."</li>
                <li>The tweet was criticized by many as being insensitive and in poor taste, particularly given the children's book character's association with family-friendly content.</li>
                <li>A spokesperson for Treehouse Media, the Canadian company that owns the rights to the Franklin books, said: "We were troubled to see the use of the Franklin character in this way and have contacted the necessary parties to address this."</li>
                <li>The implications of Hegseth's tweet suggest a lack of understanding or disregard for the wholesome branding and messaging associated with the Franklin character, which could be seen as an attempt to politicize or misuse a beloved children's icon.</li>

                <li>"We're definitely seeing a pretty steep drop in international visitation, especially from Canada," said Patrick Torsell, director of marketing at Aspen Skiing Co. in Colorado.</li>

                <li>"The political climate and some of the policies coming out of Washington, I think, have made people a little bit more hesitant to come down," Torsell said.</li>

                <li>According to Jared Rennie, co-owner of Roseline Coffee Roasters, 'It's still not back to normal. We're not seeing pre-pandemic levels in our cafes.'</li>
                <li>Tariffs on coffee imports were imposed by the Trump administration in 2018 as part of the trade war with China, leading to higher wholesale prices for roasters.</li>
                <li>Even though the tariffs have been lifted, many roasters are still dealing with the lingering effects, including higher operating costs and supply chain disruptions.</li>
                <li>Stumptown Coffee Roasters, one of Portland's largest coffee companies, has closed two of its cafes due to the pandemic and economic challenges.</li>

                <li>Kaitlin Mahar explains that "price matching" or "price protection" can help consumers save even more money during the holiday season.</li>
                <li>Price matching allows customers to request a retailer to match a lower price found elsewhere, while price protection refunds the difference if the price drops after a purchase.</li>
                <li>Many major retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart, offer price matching or price protection policies, although the specific terms and conditions vary by retailer.</li>

                <li>Ovidio Guzmán López, the son of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán, has pleaded guilty to U.S. drug trafficking charges in a deal with prosecutors.

                <li>Guzmán López pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana for importation into the United States. He faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum of life.</li>
                <li>The Sinaloa Cartel, which was led by 'El Chapo', is considered one of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world. It was responsible for smuggling tons of narcotics into the United States.</li>
                <li>Guzmán López was extradited to the U.S. in 2019 and had been scheduled to go on trial in April 2023. By pleading guilty, he avoided a potential life sentence if convicted at trial.</li>

                <li>The case involves Aisha Tamba, a former immigration judge who was fired by the U.S. Department of Justice. Tamba claims she was dismissed because of her gender, her status as a dual citizen of Lebanon and the fact that she once ran for municipal office in Ohio as a Democrat.</li>
                <li>Tamba said in her lawsuit: "I was let go for being a woman and for being a dual citizen of Lebanon, and for having run for office - for having exercised my rights."</li>
                <li>The case could have significant implications for civil rights laws in the U.S., as Tamba's lawsuit argues that the government's decision to fire her violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</li>
                <li>The lawsuit also alleges that Tamba's termination violated the First Amendment, as it was in retaliation for her running for political office.</li>
