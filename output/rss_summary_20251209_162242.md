The tracks were discovered by climbers scaling the cliffs and could provide insight into ancient turtle behavior and the effects of natural disasters on marine ecosystems.

**Key Facts:**
• The fossil tracks were discovered by climbers scaling a cliff in the Pietra di Finale formation in northwest Italy.
• The tracks appear to have been created by dozens of turtles moving in the same direction, as if they were fleeing a threat.
