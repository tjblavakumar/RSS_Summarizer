**Summary:**
• The White House said that a U.S. attack on an alleged drug boat in September included more than one strike on the vessel, seemingly confirming a Washington Post report that the U.S. targeted the boat for a second time to take out survivors of the initial attack.
• Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta discussed the strikes with "CBS Evening News" co-anchor John Dickerson.
• "I think it was a war crime. And here's why: the laws of war are very clear, that if you attack a military target, you have to be certain that there are no civilians involved. And if there are civilians, you have to take steps to avoid civilian casualties," Panetta said.
• "The fact that they went back and attacked again, after they knew there were civilians on board, I think that's a violation of the laws of war."
• "I think it raises a lot of very serious questions about how this operation was conducted and why they would do something like that." - Leon Panetta

"Genting Malaysia's shares closed 1.5% lower to 6.52 ringgit on Thursday, after the company said it would remain listed."
