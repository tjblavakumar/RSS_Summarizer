### [Fired worker sues government in a case that could upend civil rights laws](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/01/g-s1-99279/fired-worker-sues-government)

**Author:** Carrie Johnson | **Published:** 2025-12-01 17:02

• The case involves Aisha Tamba, a former immigration judge who was fired by the U.S. Department of Justice. Tamba claims she was dismissed because of her gender, her status as a dual citizen of Lebanon and the fact that she once ran for municipal office in Ohio as a Democrat.
• Tamba said in her lawsuit: "I was let go for being a woman and for being a dual citizen of Lebanon, and for having run for office - for having exercised my rights."
• The case could have significant implications for civil rights laws in the U.S., as Tamba's lawsuit argues that the government's decision to fire her violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
• The lawsuit also alleges that Tamba's termination violated the First Amendment, as it was in retaliation for her running for political office.
• The case is being closely watched by legal experts, as it could set a precedent for how civil rights laws apply to federal government employees, including judges and other officials.

### [New FDA-approved glasses can slow nearsightedness in kids](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/new-fda-approved-glasses-slow-nearsightedness-kids-127991874)

**Author:** Unknown | **Published:** 2025-12-01 05:10

• The FDA has approved a new type of lens, called MiSight, that can slow the progression of nearsightedness in children.
• According to the FDA, "MiSight 1 day contact lenses have been shown in clinical studies to slow the progression of myopia in children when initially prescribed for children 8-12 years of age."
• The MiSight lenses are designed to reshape the front of the eye and limit the elongation of the eyeball, which is the primary cause of nearsightedness.
• Nearsightedness, or myopia, is a growing problem, with rates doubling in the US over the past 50 years. Nearly 42% of Americans are now myopic.
• Slowing the progression of nearsightedness in children is important, as higher levels of myopia increase the risk of serious eye problems like retinal detachment, glaucoma, and cataracts later in life.
